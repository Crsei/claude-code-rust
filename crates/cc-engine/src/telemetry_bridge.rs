//! Telemetry bridge — allows the engine to emit telemetry spans without
//! depending on `cc-services` directly.
//!
//! The bridge is populated from `main.rs` (in `claude-code-rs`) via
//! [`install`] after the telemetry subsystem is initialized during Phase B
//! startup. Call sites in `submit_message.rs` use [`with_bridge`] to start
//! and end interaction / hook spans.
//!
//! All types are behind `#[cfg(feature = "telemetry")]` — when the feature
//! is disabled every function is a no-op.
//!
//! # Architecture (Phase 2, Serial Integration Lane)
//!
