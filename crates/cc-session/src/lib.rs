//! Session persistence — extracted as a workspace crate in Phase 4
//! (issue #73).
//!
//! Writes conversation state to `~/.cc-rust/memory/` (path unchanged by
//! the split — the acceptance test in the issue explicitly calls that
//! out). Depends on cc-bootstrap (process state), cc-compact (for the
//! export pipeline's context-window helpers), cc-types (message types),
//! cc-utils (token estimates).
