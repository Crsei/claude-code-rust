//! cc-tools: shared tool specs and pure registry helpers.
//!
//! This crate owns tool contracts and tool-facing implementations that can run
//! without depending on the engine, query loop, UI, or daemon crate. Domain
//! tools with heavier ownership boundaries remain in their target crates until
//! their dependencies can move cleanly.
