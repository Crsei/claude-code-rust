//! Pure leaf types extracted from `allthecodes::types`.
//!
//! This crate holds the subset of `src/types/` with no cross-module dependencies
//! on the main crate (teams / ui / config / ipc). The three modules below are
//! the truly pure leaves; `app_state`, `tool`, and `config` remain in the root
//! crate because they still reach into the not-yet-extracted subsystems.
//!
//! See issue #70 (`[workspace-split] Phase 1`) for the rationale behind this
//! partial split.
