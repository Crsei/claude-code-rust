//! Sandbox error types.

//! Distinguishes "the sandbox blocked this" from "the command itself
//! failed" — callers (BashTool, WebFetchTool) surface the former as a
//! policy error and the latter as an ordinary non-zero exit.

#![allow(dead_code)]
// Several SandboxError variants are part of the public policy surface but
// are only constructed from the yet-to-land path-based enforcement pass in
// BashTool/PowerShellTool (issue #8 follow-up work). Keeping them now lets
// downstream code pattern-match exhaustively without churn later.
