verification:
  - cargo test

## MCP Project Server Approval

单 server:

```text
New MCP server found in .mcp.json: playwright / Filter...
MCP servers may execute code or access system resources. All tool calls require approval.

  Use this and all future MCP servers in this project
    enable current server and trust future project MCP entries -> /mcp approve playwright --all-project
> Use this MCP server
    enable only this project MCP server -> /mcp approve playwright
  Continue without using this MCP server
    record this project MCP server as disabled -> /mcp reject playwright

Enter submit | Up/Down navigate | Esc reject
```

多 server:

```text
3 new MCP servers found in .mcp.json
Select any you wish to enable.
MCP servers may execute code or access system resources. All tool calls require approval.

  [x] github
> [ ] playwright
  [x] sentry

enable: /mcp approve github sentry
disable: /mcp reject playwright
Enter apply | Space toggle | Esc reject all
```

## LSP Recommendation

触发: LSP plugin recommendation event

```text
LSP plugin recommendation
language: Rust
plugin: rust-analyzer
reason: Cargo.toml detected

> Yes, install rust-analyzer
  No, not now
  Never for Rust
  Disable recommendations

Enter submit | Up/Down navigate | Esc no
```

关键期望:

- Yes 填充 `/plugin install rust-analyzer `。
- 当前 `/plugin` handler 是否支持 install 由命令实现决定，不在此处暗示已完整支持。

## Workspace Trust Gate

```text
Workspace trust required
path: F:/AIclassmanager/cc/rust

Do you trust this workspace?

  Exit
  Reject

Enter confirm | Esc reject
```
