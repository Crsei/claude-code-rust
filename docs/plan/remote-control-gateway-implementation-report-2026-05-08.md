# Remote Control Gateway Implementation Report

Date: 2026-05-08
Scope: Session 16 - Phase 9 Docs Release Gate

## Implemented Result

The remote-control gateway implementation now has these documented capabilities:

- `crates/gateway` owns remote source identity, deterministic session keys, run metadata, durable event storage, policy decisions, auth/origin/payload diagnostics, webhooks, adapter status, delivery targets, and startup recovery.
- Daemon integration mounts `/remote-control/v1/**` routes and bridges gateway runs to assistant-worker commands through `GatewayDaemonBridge`.
- `/remote` provides local status, adapter, run, event, stop, and doctor commands. Mutating operations use the loopback gateway API/local client instead of writing worker command files directly.
- The TUI command palette advertises `/remote`; empty `/remote` opens `RemoteSurface`; the status widget can show remote state from snapshots without blocking render-time network I/O.
- Telegram and Lark adapters expose provider-neutral configuration status, connect diagnostics, and allowlisted test-message paths.
- Declarative webhook handling supports GitHub, Slack, generic, and `/remote-control/v1/webhooks/{route_id}` route ids with HMAC, event filtering, prompt rendering, and idempotency extraction.
- Delivery routing supports `origin`, `local`, `callback:<url>`, `channel:<provider>:<target>[:thread]`, and `sse:<client-id>` target forms with callback SSRF protection.
- Recovery preserves queued runs, marks active runs as recoverable after daemon restart, retains pending approval/user runs, and records stale session-lock recovery.

## Known Limitations

- `steer` is not implemented; `supportsSteer=false` and steer requests return `501 unsupported`.
- Telegram/Lark are not full inbound conversational remote-control providers yet.
- Public hosted gateway, multi-tenant SaaS, WebSocket parity, remote desktop control, and replacing headless JSONL IPC are non-goals.
- Declarative webhooks currently use code/default route resolution plus environment secrets; a durable admin CRUD surface is follow-up work.
- Session 16 is documentation-only. Full code verification remains assigned to Session 17.

## Verification Commands

Session 16 required verification:

```powershell
rg -n "remote-control|/remote|RemoteSurface|Telegram|Lark|known issue|follow-up" docs
git diff --check
```

Session 16 also requires the plan's line-count/refactor check after docs edits:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem crates\gateway\src,crates\claude-code-rs\src\daemon,crates\claude-code-rs\src\commands,crates\claude-code-rs\src\ui\components -Recurse -Include *.rs |
  ForEach-Object { [pscustomobject]@{ File = $_.FullName; Lines = (Get-Content $_.FullName).Count } } |
  Where-Object { $_.Lines -gt 450 } |
  Sort-Object Lines -Descending
```

Full implementation verification to run in the final verification session:

```powershell
git diff --check
cargo test -p gateway
cargo test -p claude-code-rs remote_cmd ui::components::command_palette ui::components::command_surface ui::components::status_widget
cargo test -p claude-code-rs daemon::protocol daemon::routes daemon::sse daemon::supervisor
cargo check -p claude-code-rs --message-format short
```

## Untested Items In This Session

- Full `cargo test -p gateway`.
- Full targeted `claude-code-rs` daemon, remote command, and TUI test set.
- Manual daemon smoke using `/remote status`, `/remote adapters`, and `/remote runs`.
- Real Telegram and Lark network credentials.
- Real webhook HMAC request against a running daemon.

## Line-Count Check Result

The required line-count/refactor check still reports pre-existing files over 450 lines, including `daemon/process_state.rs`, several generic command modules, `daemon/routes.rs`, and UI history/search files. Session 16 is docs-only and did not split code. Remote-control-specific threshold notes:

- `crates/claude-code-rs/src/commands/remote_cmd.rs` did not appear in the over-450 output.
- Remote-control route logic is split into `crates/claude-code-rs/src/daemon/gateway_routes.rs` and `crates/gateway/src/api.rs`; the large `daemon/routes.rs` file remains a broader daemon file-size debt, not a Session 16 code change.

## Follow-Up Plan

1. Run Session 17 final verification commands and resolve the first actionable failure before any release claim.
2. Add or document an operator-facing webhook route management surface if declarative webhooks need runtime CRUD.
3. Implement true Telegram/Lark inbound conversation control as a separate phase, preserving the current adapter boundary.
4. Revisit `steer` only after `QueryEngine` has explicit mid-turn steering semantics.
5. Keep non-loopback remote-control deployment behind explicit remote-token/origin policy and release notes.

## Documentation Updated

- `docs/reference/REMOTE_CONTROL_GATEWAY.md`
- `docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md`
- `docs/FINAL_RELEASE_PLAN.md`
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
- `docs/plan/remote-control-gateway-implementation-report-2026-05-08.md`

## Remaining Risk

The documentation now describes the intended release boundary, but Session 16 did not execute the full Rust test/check gate. Release readiness still depends on Session 17 verification and any fixes it requires.
