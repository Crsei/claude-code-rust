# Tools Phase 6 - Final Verification

Date: 2026-05-06

## Scope

Phase 6 closes the tools implementation phase plan after Tasks V2 parity work and Web provider-difference documentation.
It also fixes a concurrency issue found during final verification: same-process concurrent task creation could occasionally fall back to UUID ids when multiple threads contended on the high-watermark lock.

## Changes

- Added a process-local ID reservation mutex to `TaskRepository`.
- Kept the existing `.highwatermark.lock` file guard for cross-process protection.
- Updated `docs/WORK_STATUS.md` to mark Tasks V2 as complete in the tool status table.
- Recorded final verification evidence and unrelated blockers.
- Added a narrow build-stability follow-up so clean verification checkouts are self-contained: the tracked tree now includes `model_registry.rs` and exports the already referenced execution sandbox helper.

## Verification

- `rustfmt --edition 2021 --check crates\claude-code-rs\src\tools\tasks.rs` passed.
- `cargo test -p claude-code-rs tools::tasks` passed: 58 passed.
- `cargo test -p claude-code-rs teams::mailbox::tests::test_mark_all_as_read -- --nocapture` passed after the broad team-filter run exposed a one-off path race.
- Clean-checkout verification at `e28da8e` passed `cargo test -p claude-code-rs tools::tasks`: 58 passed.
- Clean-checkout verification at `e28da8e` passed `cargo test -p claude-code-rs team -- --test-threads=1`: 119 passed.
- Clean-checkout verification at `e28da8e` passed `cargo build --release`.

## Blockers Outside This Phase

- Clean-checkout `cargo fmt --check` still fails on pre-existing formatting drift outside the tools phase. Examples include `crates/cc-mcp/src/manager.rs`, `crates/cc-permissions/src/dangerous.rs`, `crates/cc-sandbox/src/policy.rs`, `crates/cc-services/src/session_memory.rs`, `crates/cc-session/src/memdir.rs`, and several API/UI files. The main worktree has overlapping dirty changes in these files, so this phase did not auto-format them.
- The live dirty worktree can still be blocked by unrelated in-progress work. During final audit, `cargo test -p claude-code-rs tools::tasks` in the live tree failed before tests because dirty `crates/cc-mcp/src/lib.rs` referenced a missing `auth` module; the clean checkout at `e28da8e` passed the same tools test.

## Result

The tools implementation map now has no remaining tool-family-level partial implementation item.
Task management is marked implemented in `architecture/tools-implementation-map.md`; WebSearch / WebFetch remain implemented with provider/runtime differences documented in `architecture/web-tools-provider-diff.md`.
